# ReactPortfolio
Portfolio built using React.js

My portfolio showcasing some of the projects I feel demonstrate my skills as a developer. The profile is built using React.js with a 
mobile-first design in mind. Some of the styling is custom in-line styling but the mobile-responsiveness was built out using Material-UI
for React.js.
