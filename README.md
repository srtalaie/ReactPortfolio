# ReactPortfolio
Portfolio built using React.js

My portfolio showcasing some of the projects I feel demonstrate my skills as a developer. The profile is built using React.js with a 
mobile-first design in mind. Some of the styling is custom in-line styling but the mobile-responsiveness was built out using Material-UI
for React.js.

Each project has a short description and a link when clicked takes you to the GitHub Repo, and within those repo's ReadMe's are links to the project pages.
